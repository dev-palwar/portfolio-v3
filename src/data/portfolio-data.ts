  bio: `Hey there! I'm Dev - and yes, that's my real name! In what might be the universe's most fitting coincidence, I also happen to be a developer. Talk about destiny, right?. Well I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications. I like to work with startups and building cool stuff and sharing it on twt to impress those cool anime dp anons. I also do freelance work and have delivered multiple projects. So far I have worked with Javascript , on both frontend and backend. Right now, I'm learning Devops and advanced backends.`,
