  bio: `Hey there! I'm Dev - and yes, that's my real name! In what might be the universe's most fitting coincidence, I also happen to be a developer. Talk about destiny, right?. Well I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications. My aim is to learn everything quickly and graduate at a senior level that's why I like to work with startups. I also do freelance work when I have nothing to do or just build cool stuff and share it on twt to impress those cool anime dp anons. So far I have worked with Javascript, on both frontend and backend. Right now, I'm learning Devops and advanced backends.`,
