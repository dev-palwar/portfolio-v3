In March, I was deep in the misery that is job hunting.

I had been trying to move abroad for a while by then, and I was just… done. Frustrated, burnt out, and tired of the soul-sucking loop of applications, interviews, and rejections.

So when a friend suggested a weekend hike, I said yes mostly because it felt easier than opening LinkedIn again.

What I did not expect was that this random hike would quietly reset a lot of things for me — not because it was magical, but because it forced me to feel stuck in a very physical, very undeniable way.
